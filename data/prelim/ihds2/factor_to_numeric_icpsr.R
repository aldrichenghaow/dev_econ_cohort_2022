# factor_to_numeric_icpsr.R
# 2012/12/06
#
# Convert R factor variable back to numeric in an ICPSR-produced R data
# frame. This works because the original numeric codes were prepended by
# ICSPR to the factor levels in the process of converting the original
# numeric categorical variable to factor during R data frame generation.
#
# REQUIRES add.value.labels function from prettyR package
#    http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/prettyR/index.html
#
#
# Substitute the actual variable and data frame names for da99999.0001$MYVAR
# placeholders in syntax below.
#
#    data frame = da99999.0001
#    variable   = MYVAR
#
#
# Line-by-line comments:
#
# (1) Load prettyR package
#
# (2) Create object (lbls) containing the factor levels for the specified
#     variable.  Sort will be numeric as original codes (zero-padded, if
#     necessary) were preserved in the factor levels.
#
# (3) Strip original codes from lbls, leaving only the value labels, e.g.,
#       "(01) STRONGLY DISAGREE" becomes "STRONGLY DISAGREE"
#
# (4) Strip labels from data, leaving only the original codes, e.g.,
#       "(01) STRONGLY DISAGREE" becomes "1"
#
#     Then, coerce variable to numeric
#
# (5) Add value labels, making this a named numeric vector
