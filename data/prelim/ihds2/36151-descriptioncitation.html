The India Human Development Survey-II (IHDS-II), 2011-12  is a nationally representative, multi-topic survey of 42,152 households in 1,503 villages and 971 urban neighborhoods across India. These data are mostly re-interviews of households interviewed for IHDS-I (ICPSR 22626) in 2004-05. Two one-hour interviews in each household covered topics concerning health, education, employment, economic status, marriage, fertility, gender relations, social capital, village infrastructure, wage levels, and panchayat composition. Children aged 8-11 completed short reading, writing and arithmetic tests.</p>
<p>The IHDS-II data are assembled in fourteen datasets:</p>
<ol>
<li>Individual</li>
<li>Household</li>
<li>Eligible Women</li>
<li>Birth History</li>
<li>Medical Staff</li>
<li>Medical Facilities</li>

		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> All 2004-05 households residing in the same village or urban neighborhood were re-interviewed. When households had divided, all split households were re-interviewed if located in the same village/neighborhood. For some urban PSUs where it was difficult to re-contact sufficient households, additional new households were randomly sampled and interviewed.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Universe:</strong> Nationally representative sample of the Indian population.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Unit(s) of Observation:</strong> Village, Individual, Household, DS8 and DS9: School, Urban Block</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Data Type(s):</strong> survey data</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Mode of Data Collection:</strong> cognitive assessment test, face-to-face interview, paper and pencil interview (PAPI)</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Response Rates:</strong> 85 percent of 2004-05 households were re-interviewed.</span></p>
