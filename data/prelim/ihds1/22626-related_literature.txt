Fetching or Snatching? Effects of Arbitrage on India's Public Distribution
System." IFPRI Discussion Paper 01588. Washington, DC: International Food
Policy Research Institute, Dec 2016.
Abstract: https://books.google.com/books?id=dzfdDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s
Would households be able to buy more subsidized grains from a food-based
safety-net program if the difference between prices in the program and in
the open market were to increase? This is an important question for safety-
net programs anywhere in the world, but particularly so for the public
distribution system (PDS) of grains in India—the largest food-based safety-
net program in the world. The standard economic intuition suggests that
price controls distort signals and create incentives for unintended
transactions. Price difference between the PDS and the open market
compromise entitlements and divert grains to open markets—an entitlement-
snatching effect. Drèze and Sen (2013), however, posit the opposite—an
entitlement-fetching effect, where an increase in arbitrage increases the
value of PDS entitlement. This raises the stakes in the PDS for eligible
beneficiaries, resulting in a rise in accountability and ultimately an
increase in household purchases of grains from the PDS. We test these two
competing hypotheses using multiple datasets: consumer expenditure surveys
conducted by the National Sample Survey Organization, and panel datasets
from the India Human Development Survey and the Village Dynamics in South
Asia. Depending on the context, we find both entitlement-snatching and
entitlement-fetching effects. In states where welfare programs are better
governed, the Drèze and Sen (2013) conjecture holds. Conversely, in states
like Bihar and Jharkhand—where welfare programs are poorly run—the opposite
pattern holds; that is, households’ purchase of subsidized grains recedes
with greater arbitrage.

Would households be able to buy more subsidized grains from a food-based
safety-net program if the difference between prices in the program and in
the open market were to increase? This is an important question for safety-
net programs anywhere in the world, but particularly so for the public
distribution system (PDS) of grains in India—the largest food-based safety-
net program in the world. The standard economic intuition suggests that
price controls distort signals and create incentives for unintended
transactions. Price difference between the PDS and the open market
compromise entitlements and divert grains to open markets—an entitlement-
snatching effect. Drèze and Sen (2013), however, posit the opposite—an
entitlement-fetching effect, where an increase in arbitrage increases the
value of PDS entitlement. This raises the stakes in the PDS for eligible
beneficiaries, resulting in a rise in accountability and ultimately an
increase in household purchases of grains from the PDS. We test these two
competing hypotheses using multiple datasets: consumer expenditure surveys
conducted by the National Sample Survey Organization, and panel datasets
from the India Human Development Survey and the Village Dynamics in South
Asia. Depending on the context, we find both entitlement-snatching and
entitlement-fetching effects. In states where welfare programs are better
governed, the Drèze and Sen (2013) conjecture holds. Conversely, in states
like Bihar and Jharkhand—where welfare programs are poorly run—the opposite
pattern holds; that is, households’ purchase of subsidized grains recedes
with greater arbitrage.

This paper studies how aggregate economic conditions affect marriage
markets in developing countries where marriage is regulated by traditional
customary norms. We examine how local economic shocks influence the timing
of marriage, and particularly child marriage, in Sub-Saharan Africa and in
India, where substantial monetary or in-kind transfers occur with marriage:
bride price across Sub-Saharan Africa and dowry in India. In a simple
equilibrium model of the marriage market in which parents choose when their
children marry, income shocks affect the age of marriage because marriage
payments are a source of consumption smoothing, particularly for a woman's
family. As predicted by our model, we show that droughts, which reduce
annual crop yields by 10 to 15%, have opposite effects on the marriage
behavior of a sample of 400,000 women in the two regions: in Sub-Saharan
Africa, they increase the annual hazard into child marriage by 3%, while in
India droughts reduce such a hazard by 4%. Changes in the age of marriage
due to droughts are associated with changes in fertility, especially in
Sub-Saharan Africa, and with declines in observed marriage payments. Our
results indicate that the age of marriage responds to short-term changes in
aggregate economic conditions and that traditional norms determine this
response. This suggests that, in order to design successful policies to
combat child marriage and improve investments in daughters' human capital,
it is crucial to understand the economic role of traditional cultural
norms.

This paper studies how aggregate economic conditions affect marriage
markets in developing countries where marriage is regulated by traditional
customary norms. We examine how local economic shocks influence the timing
of marriage, and particularly child marriage, in Sub-Saharan Africa and in
India, where substantial monetary or in-kind transfers occur with marriage:
bride price across Sub-Saharan Africa and dowry in India. In a simple
equilibrium model of the marriage market in which parents choose when their
children marry, income shocks affect the age of marriage because marriage
payments are a source of consumption smoothing, particularly for a woman's
family. As predicted by our model, we show that droughts, which reduce
annual crop yields by 10 to 15%, have opposite effects on the marriage
behavior of a sample of 400,000 women in the two regions: in Sub-Saharan
Africa, they increase the annual hazard into child marriage by 3%, while in
India droughts reduce such a hazard by 4%. Changes in the age of marriage
due to droughts are associated with changes in fertility, especially in
Sub-Saharan Africa, and with declines in observed marriage payments. Our
results indicate that the age of marriage responds to short-term changes in
aggregate economic conditions and that traditional norms determine this
response. This suggests that, in order to design successful policies to
combat child marriage and improve investments in daughters' human capital,
it is crucial to understand the economic role of traditional cultural
norms.

Barker's fetal origins hypothesis suggests a strong relationship between in
utero conditions, health and overall child development after birth. Using
nationally representative population survey, this paper analyzes the impact
of rainfall on early child health in rural India. We find that drought
experienced in utero has detrimental effects on nutritional status of
children. Effects appear to be stronger for boys, low caste children, and
children exposed to drought in the first trimester. Results are robust to
alternative definitions of drought. Our estimates speculate that policies
aimed at reducing vulnerability to negative rainfall shock may result into
improved health and higher human capital accumulation in rain-dependent
agrarian countries.
