# Hi folks, welcome to the Development Economics Cohort of 2022-2023!
This is our GitHub repository, which is where we will store all files related to our ongoing research project.

## Repo Description:
- **code**: This folder mainly contains programming exercises about different aspects of data work - data visualization, data transformation, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis with real datasets, etc. Our members are able to gain a complete overview of data analysis and programming in R after finishing these workbook exercises (All the exercises can be accessed by clicking on the workbook folder.)
- **data**: This data folder contains two large data sets that our members can use for their own exploration of development economics. Inside the "prelim", members are able to find sub-folders named "data_world_bank", "ihds1", and "ihds2".
- **stats**: This folder contains the slides of our short statistics presentations.

Hope all of you enjoy playing with this repository and have fun learning R!
